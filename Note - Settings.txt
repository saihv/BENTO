Note on COM Port configuration:

- the Iridium modem should be connected to COM3 
  and COM3 should be supplied by 12 V
  The Sutron box needs to be open and the jumper configuration p 121 of User Manual 
  (p131 in "Sutron_9210B Use Manual.pdf") for [+12 SW'D] 
  should be set for COM3 (the set of jumper for COM3 is shown on p 122 (p132 in "Sutron_9210B Use Manual.pdf")   

- The same jumper configuration should be applied to COM4 where the CO2 sensor's DB-9 connector should be plugged 

Note on new Code (25/06/2012):

measureSO2.bas => This last file is not used anymore after the changes via GUI I made to gather the SO2 values.
